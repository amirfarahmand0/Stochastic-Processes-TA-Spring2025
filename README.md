# Stochastic-Processes-TA-Spring2025
Repository for Stochastic Processes TA course (Spring 2025). Contains assignments, project guidelines, and resources for students and teaching assistants.


### Mini Project 1: Value Iteration in a Grid Environment

In this project, students will be introduced to the basics of **reinforcement learning** by implementing the **Value Iteration** algorithm on a discrete Grid environment (e.g., FrozenLake from OpenAI Gym).

### Objectives
- Understand how agents interact with an environment in the RL framework
- Implement the **Value Iteration** algorithm
- Derive an optimal deterministic policy from the value function
- Test the implementation in a stochastic grid-based environment

### Deliverables
- Python implementation of value iteration
- Visualization or output logs showing convergence of the value function
- A short report explaining the algorithm and results
