Consider a two-server system where customers must go through server 1 and then server 2, and where the service time at server $i$ is exponential with parameter $\mu_i$. Customer A arrives and finds server 1 free and two customers at server 2, one in service and one waiting. Find the expected value of the time T customer A spends in the system.
