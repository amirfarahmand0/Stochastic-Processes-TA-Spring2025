Let \(\{X(t) : t \geq 0\}\) be a Poisson process with rate \(\lambda\) :
   \subparagraph{a)} If \(T_1, T_2, \cdots, T_n\) are arrival times for the \(n\) events, show that \(\mathbb{P}(T_1 \leq t_1, \cdots, T_n \leq t_n \mid X(t) = n)\) is free of \(\lambda\).

   \subparagraph{b)} Let \(T\) be a random variable that is independent of the times when events occur. Suppose that \(T\) has an exponential density with parameter \(\nu\). Find the distribution of \(X(T)\), which is the number of events occurring by time \(T\).
