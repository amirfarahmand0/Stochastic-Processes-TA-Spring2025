There are $n$ different types of coupons and each time someone collects a coupon, it is independently of type $i$ with probability $p_i$. We want to compute the expected value of the number $N$ of coupons one needs to collect to have at least one coupon of each type. Assuming that coupons are collected at rate one and letting $T$ be the time it takes to have the complete collection in this continuous-time setting, prove that:
$$E(N)=E(T)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1- \prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-e^{-p_it})\right)dt.$$
